# Development Session Log

## Session 1 - Initial Setup & Core Functionality Fixes
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Duration:** ~1 hour

### üîß Initial Setup & Analysis
- **Created CLAUDE.md** - Analyzed the codebase and created comprehensive documentation for future Claude Code instances
  - Essential development commands (`./scripts/dev.sh`, `docker-compose up --build`)
  - Architecture overview (3-layer .NET solution with secure lab execution)
  - Database operations and Entity Framework commands
  - Testing and deployment workflows

### üîê Authentication System Fixes
#### Fixed Login Validation Scripts
- **Issue:** 404 error when clicking Login button due to missing `_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml`
- **Solution:** Created `/src/LearnCSharp.Web/Pages/Shared/_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml`
- **Added:** jQuery validation libraries for client-side validation
- **Result:** Login page now loads without validation scripts errors

#### Fixed Logout Functionality  
- **Issue:** 404 error when clicking Logout button - page model existed but Razor page was missing
- **Solution:** Created `/src/LearnCSharp.Web/Pages/Auth/Logout.cshtml`
- **Added:** Simple logout confirmation page with proper styling
- **Result:** Users can now successfully log out and are redirected to home page

### üìö Learning Tracks Feature Implementation
#### Built Complete Tracks Section
- **Issue:** 404 error when clicking "View All Tracks" from homepage
- **Solution:** Created full `/Tracks` page functionality
- **Files Created:**
  - `/src/LearnCSharp.Web/Pages/Tracks.cshtml.cs` - Page model loading published tracks with lessons from database
  - `/src/LearnCSharp.Web/Pages/Tracks.cshtml` - Professional UI with track cards
- **Features:**
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Track cards showing title, description, lesson count, estimated time
  - Lesson previews (first 6 lessons per track)
  - Different CTAs for authenticated vs anonymous users
  - Empty state handling when no tracks exist
  - Professional layout matching existing design system

### üê≥ Docker Management
- **Container Rebuilds:** Performed multiple `docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build` cycles
- **Reason:** Application runs in Docker, new files needed to be included in container image
- **Process:** Each new file creation required container rebuild to be accessible

### ‚úÖ Current Application State
**Working Features:**
- ‚úÖ User authentication (login/logout) with proper validation
- ‚úÖ Homepage with featured tracks display
- ‚úÖ Complete Tracks listing page with database integration
- ‚úÖ Professional UI with consistent Tailwind CSS styling
- ‚úÖ Responsive navigation between pages
- ‚úÖ Database-driven content display using Entity Framework

**Architecture Verified:**
- ‚úÖ ASP.NET Core 8 with Razor Pages
- ‚úÖ Entity Framework Core with SQLite (development)
- ‚úÖ ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication
- ‚úÖ Clean 3-layer architecture (Core/Web/Tests)
- ‚úÖ Docker containerization with Docker Compose
- ‚úÖ Secure lab execution system for coding challenges

**Next Session Priorities:**
- Individual track detail pages (`/Tracks/{slug}`)
- Dashboard functionality for authenticated users
- Lesson and lab content management
- User progress tracking implementation
- Additional seeded content for demonstration
